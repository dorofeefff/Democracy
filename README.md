#### Experimental Software

This is the software that we used to run the experiment "Decomposing the Democracy Effect." This project explores how and why democratically chosen rules change people's behavior when they face social dilemmas. You can read more about the study at Sasha's [webpage](https://sashadorofeev.net/research).

You can run a demo of the experiment online using Heroku:
1. Go to https://democracy-demo.herokuapp.com/
2. Click "Democracy Baseline"
3. Open the experiment in a split screen mode or open the session-wide demo link 3 times

Note that once you complete Part I of the experiment (page 8: WaitBetweenParts), you need to manually advance all users to Part II. If you test the software in the split screen mode, press ``Advance slowest user(s)`` button. If you have each participant's screen on a separate tab, go back to the session's homepage, press ``Monitor`` and then ``Advance slowest user(s)``.

You can also run the experiment locally, but you need to install [oTree](https://www.otree.org/) to your computer first.
